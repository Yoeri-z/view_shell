# view_shell

A minimal, intuitive, and boilerplate-free state management library for Flutter. `view_shell` gracefully handles loading, error, and valid states for your widgets, ensuring a clean architecture and a robust user experience.

The core idea is to wrap your page or complex widget in a `ViewShell`, which observes a set of properties (`Prop`s). The `ViewShell` automatically displays a loading indicator, an error message, or your UI, based on the collective state of these properties.
